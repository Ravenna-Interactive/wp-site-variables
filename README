A WordPress Plugin ============================================

Allows a multisite install to provide site defined variables that can be used
throughout the site.

After installing for the plugin to function the Network Admin can define a
list of variables that can be configured for each site. This can be configured
by using the "Super Admin -> Site Variables" menu in the admin.

Once variables are defined. Site admins can configure the values for these
variables by using the "Settings -> Site Variables" menu item.

Use this template tag to use the variables in your theme:

  <?php multivars_value('Variable Name'); ?>
